# 1]PCA Project with Scala 

<h3>The Dataset used is Cancer_Data</h3>

Here is a description of the dataset we will be using:

Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Database

--------------
Data Set Characteristics:

Number of Instances: 569

Number of Attributes: 30 numeric, predictive attributes and the class

Attribute Information:

//         - radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)

//         - texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)

//         - perimeter

//         - area

//         - smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)

//         - compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)

//         - concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)

//         - concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)

//         - symmetry

//         - fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

//
//         The mean, standard error, and "worst" or largest (mean of the three
//         largest values) of these features were computed for each image,
//         resulting in 30 features.  For instance, field 3 is Mean Radius, field
//         13 is Radius SE, field 23 is Worst Radius


# 2] K-Means Clustering 
Your task will be to try to cluster clients of a Wholesale Distributor

// based off of the sales of some product categories

<h3>The dataset is customers.csv</h3>

// Source of the Data

//http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers

// Here is the info on the data:

// 1)	FRESH: annual spending (m.u.) on fresh products (Continuous);

// 2)	MILK: annual spending (m.u.) on milk products (Continuous);

// 3)	GROCERY: annual spending (m.u.)on grocery products (Continuous);

// 4)	FROZEN: annual spending (m.u.)on frozen products (Continuous)

// 5)	DETERGENTS_PAPER: annual spending (m.u.) on detergents and paper products (Continuous)

// 6)	DELICATESSEN: annual spending (m.u.)on and delicatessen products (Continuous);

// 7)	CHANNEL: customers Channel - Horeca (Hotel/Restaurant/Cafe) or Retail channel (Nominal)

// 8)	REGION: customers Region- Lisnon, Oporto or Other (Nominal)


# 3] Classification-Logistic Regression

In this project we will be working with a fake advertising data set, indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement. We will try to create a model that will predict whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user.

//  This data set contains the following features:

<h3>The dataset used is advertising.csv</h3>

//    'Daily Time Spent on Site': consumer time on site in minutes

//    'Age': cutomer age in years

//    'Area Income': Avg. Income of geographical area of consumer

//    'Daily Internet Usage': Avg. minutes a day consumer is on the internet

//    'Ad Topic Line': Headline of the advertisement

//    'City': City of consumer

//    'Male': Whether or not consumer was male

//    'Country': Country of consumer

//    'Timestamp': Time at which consumer clicked on Ad or closed window

//    'Clicked on Ad': 0 or 1 indicated clicking on Ad


# 4]Linear Regression

You are given dataset containing customer information for a ecommerce company

<h3>The Dataset is Ecommerce.csv</h3>

Give a set of features ,create a yearly model to predict the Yearly Amount Expenditure of the customer.
